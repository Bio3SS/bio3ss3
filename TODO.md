* rationalize par("ask") behaviour (was turned on automatically; should be turned *on* by default if returnPlotList=FALSE (i.e. printing plots)
* divOffset?
* more documentation of models
* integrate other models (theta-logistic, logistic)
* stochastic models? (realized-r vs density plots?)
* expand dynamics plots to allow zero
* expand/collapse parameter table based on "allee' check box?
* modularize more generally
* print param info on plot
* hash based on getenv("USER"), or macid name?
* redo reportSim based on N0=0?
* show stability info, equilibria?
* more generally, how do we manage the complexity of the interface?  Shiny is very space-limited ...
